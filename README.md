# fvecs - vector file formats

The library implement codec for .bvecs, .fvecs and .ivecs vector file formats 
developed by [INRIA LEAR and TEXMEX groups](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr).

## Inspiration

Vector file formats (.bvecs, .fvecs and .ivecs) is a serialized sequence of vectors `[]byte`, `[]float32` or `[]int32`.

Each vector is

```
      32bit          ‚ü®ùíÖ‚ü© * n-bits 
|--------------|-------/ ... /-------|
 ‚ü®ùíÖ‚ü© dimension
```

- .fvecs stores 32-bit float (n = 32bit)
- .ivecs stores 32-bit signed or unsigned integers (n = 32bits)
- .bvecs stores bytes (n = 8bit)

## Getting started

The latest version of the library is available at `main` branch of this repository. All development, including new features and bug fixes, take place on the `main` branch using forking and pull requests as described in contribution guidelines. The stable version is available via Golang modules.

```go
import "github.com/kshard/fvecs"

//
// Reading vectors
r, err := os.Open("siftsmall_base.fvecs")
d := fvecs.NewDecoder[float32](r)

for {
  v, err := d.Read()
  if err != nil {
    break
  }
}

//
// Writing vectors
w, err := os.Create("siftsmall_base.fvecs")
e := fvecs.NewEncoder[float32](w)

for _, v := range /* source of []float32 vectors */ {
  err := e.Write(v)
  if err != nil {
    break
  }
}
```

## How To Contribute
